# 02 - Final AT1

## The first draft of my AT1 - P5 Sketch moves slowly. 
## I do not think the teacher will sit in front of the desk to see it moving slowly for 5minutes. 
## Then I accidentally changed some parameters of the speeds, and I got my codes like the Disco Lighting which runs super fast. 
## I like the Disco Light style and hope the teacher will not feel dizzy.
